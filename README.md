# Data Structures & Algorithms 🚀

This repository is a personal space where I practice and implement fundamental **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**, aiming to build a strong foundation for problem-solving and competitive programming.

The project is still in progress — I’m starting with the basics and expanding step-by-step.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Practice implementing DS & Algorithms from scratch  
- Improve problem-solving logic  
- Prepare for coding interviews  
- Build a clean, documented reference I can always go back to  



## 💡 Notes
- This project will be updated continuously as I study and practice.
- Every topic will include clean code, examples, and documentation.
